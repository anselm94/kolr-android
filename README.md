A colorful, simple game for boring instances of life. Play with colored tiles and protect them from disappearing! This is a simple game made by myself and my bro (aka <a href="http://anselmbros.blogspot.in/">Visit W3Schools</a>) and released January 1, 2015 on Google Play Store.

<b>HOW TO PLAY?</b></br>
<b>Intro:</b></br>
Each tile has five states through light variant of a color to the darkest. Once the tile gets a color out of these five states (too darker or too lighter), the tile gets 'killed'. Once all the 9 tiles are killed, the game gets over!

<b>What happens once started playing?</b></br>The tiles get <i>darker</i> for every 'tick' randomly (one tile at each tick). The time interval of each tick, varies with difficulty and level.

<b>What should I do?</b></br>
Tapping a tile makes it <i>lighter</i>. Simple to play right?... No, it is not!
