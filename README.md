#Kolr - A Color Tapping Game for Android
A colorful, simple game for boring instances of life. Play with colored tiles and protect them from disappearing!

##HOW TO PLAY?
###Intro:
Each tile has five states through light variant of a color to the darkest. Once the tile gets a color out of these five states (too darker or too lighter), the tile gets 'killed'. Once all the 9 tiles are killed, the game gets over!

###What happens once started playing?
The tiles get *darker* for every 'tick' randomly (one tile at each tick). The time interval of each tick, varies with difficulty and level.

###What should I do?
Tapping a tile makes it *lighter*. Simple to play right?... No, it is not!
